# emesh
This will be my first attempt at creating a NES game. Most of what I am doing
is being taught to my by http://nesdoug.com

# Storyline
Emesh needs to bring his sheep back alive. Help him out.

# Installation and getting started.
To run the contents of the package and to create the `.nes` ROM you need the cc65 package. Which can compile the C-code to assembler and make `.nes` ROM out of
assembler code and binary sprite files.

The easiest method on a debian-like (e.g. ubuntu) is to add the repository to your sources list.
The instructions can be found here:
